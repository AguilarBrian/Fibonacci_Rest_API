# Fibonacci Rest API

A basic Node.js Fibonacci Service using JavaScript with Node.js and Express.js<br/>
<br/>

## How to use it

**`git clone`** this respository or a fork of this repository<br/>
**Install** the dependencies with `npm i` or `npm install` on the project folder.<br/>
**Run** the server with `npm start`<br/>
**Test** it with Postman or any API client. You can also use the browser as a client.<br/>
To make the request, you must put the index number in the Fibonacci series that you want to receive, by params<br/>
I.E.: `http://localhost:3001/3` will bring the value "2" because the index "3" in the Fibonacci sequence corresponds to the number "2"<br/>
<br/>
